# Spotify Playlist Splitter

This project is a little fun project I worked on during the winter break of 2021. 

Its goal is to split enormous Spotify playlists into smaller playlists, categorized by the songs' genres. For example, if a Spotify user has an hour long playlist full of rock, jazz, hip-hop, dance songs, my project would create new Spotify playlists and add them to the user library, each having songs of a certain genre (rock playlist having rock songs from the original playlist, jazz playlist having jazz compositions from the OG playlist, etc.). 

With this project I first encountered working with APIs. In particular, I used Spotify API and their Python "Spotipy" library for communicating with the user's library, fetching and creating playlists, adding songs, etc. Moreover, I used the Last.fm API for fetching songs' genres to properly categorize them in their respective playlists.

I am currently working on the front-end of this application.
