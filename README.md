# SpotifyPlaylistSplitterByGenre

This project is a little fun project I worked on during the winter break of 2021. 

Its goal is to split enormous Spotify playlists into smaller playlists, categorized by the songs' genres. For example, if a Spotify user has an hour long playlist full of rock, jazz, hip-hop, dance songs, my project would create new Spotify playlists and add them to the user library, each having songs of a certain genre (rock playlist having rock songs from the original playlist, jazz playlist having jazz compositions from the OG playlist, etc.). 

I am currently working on the front-end of this application.
